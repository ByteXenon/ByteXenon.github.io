            <p>
              Hi there! My name is Luna, and I'm an ethical hacker and
              programmer who loves coffee milk!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm an outgoing person who loves to meet new people and learn
              about different cultures. In my free time, I enjoy reading books,
              playing video games, and exploring nature. In addition, I'm an
              activist for freedom and strongly believe in the importance of
              free internet access for all. I fight against censorship and
              strive to promote open communication and the sharing of
              information.
            </p>
            <h2 id="languages-and-skills">Languages and Skills</h2>
            <p>
              I have a strong background in several programming languages,
              including C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Lua, and
              Assembly. I'm also skilled in using markup and stylesheet
              languages like HTML and CSS to create and style web content.
              Currently, I'm learning Rust to expand my skillset. My experience
              spans both Linux and Windows environments, and I've worked with a
              variety of Linux distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, Slackware,
              Ubuntu, RHEL, OpenSUSE, Fedora, and Kali Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
              My main focus is on the
              <a href="https://github.com/ByteXenon/LuaXen"
                >Lua Compiler/Deobfuscator</a
              >, but I also enjoy working on various side projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my programming skills, I'm also experienced in
              using tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I know how to configure
              and set up Linux systems, and have experience compiling and
              configuring the kernel from source. I've even built my own Linux
              system from scratch by following the books
              <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"
                >Linux From Scratch</a
              >
              and
              <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/"
                >Beyond Linux From Scratch</a
              >.

            <h2 id="ethical-hacking">Ethical Hacking</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to programming, I'm also passionate about ethical
              hacking. I'm pretty good with Kali Linux and I have made scripts
              and programs to help with ethical hacking. I have successfully
              identified and reported vulnerabilities for notable companies such
              as
              <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>

              I believe in the importance of sharing knowledge and am always
              eager to help others learn about ethical hacking, programming, or
              Linux. Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested!
