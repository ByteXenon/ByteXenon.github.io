## About me

Hi there! My name is Luna, and I'm a 17-year-old ethical hacker and programmer who loves coffee milk!

I'm an outgoing person who loves to meet new people and learn about different cultures. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and exploring nature. I'm also a big fan of music and love to attend concerts whenever I can.
In addition, I'm an activist for freedom and strongly believe in the importance of free internet access for all. I fight against censorship and strive to promote open communication and the sharing of information.

I'm fine with She/Her, and They/Them pronouns.

## Languages and Skills

I have a strong background in several programming languages, including C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Lua, and Assembly. I’m also skilled in using markup and stylesheet languages like HTML and CSS to create and style web content. Currently, I’m learning Rust to expand my skillset.
My experience spans both Linux and Windows environments, and I've worked with a variety of Linux distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, Slackware, Ubuntu, RHEL, OpenSUSE, Fedora, and Kali Linux.

My main focus is on the Lua Compiler, but I also enjoy working on various side projects.

In addition to my programming skills, I’m also experienced in using tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I know how to configure and set up Linux systems, and have experience compiling and configuring the kernel from source. I’ve even built my own Linux system from scratch by following the books [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) and [Beyond Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/).

## Ethical Hacking

In addition to programming, I'm also passionate about ethical hacking. I'm proficient in Kali Linux and have developed scripts and programs to aid in ethical hacking endeavors.
I have experience with Responsible Disclosure and Bug Bounty programs and have successfully identified and reported vulnerabilities for notable companies such as [Github](https://github.com), [Roblox](https://roblox.com), and [Shodan](https://shodan.io).

## Sharing Knowledge

I believe in the importance of sharing knowledge and am always eager to help others learn about ethical hacking, programming, or Linux. Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested!

## Blogging

I also maintain a blog where I write about topics related to ethical hacking and programming.
